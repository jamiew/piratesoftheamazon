This is an improved version of the Firefox extension Pirates of the Amazon, which gives you direct links to torrents on The Pirate Bay when a torrent can be found that relates to the page you are looking at on Amazon.com. It has been modified from version 0.6.1, originally written by Enrique B. and John S. Problems fixed include image links not displaying and several privacy concerns. The images are thanks to legaliamnot.
